My commute used to take me through Kharghar on the way to college.
But, I was fresh to Mumbai. I was clueless on how to get here in a hurry.
I searched high and low over the internet for more effective options.
However, we were unable to locate any.
After that, I decided, "Fine, I'll do it myself."
